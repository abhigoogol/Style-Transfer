# Style-Transfer
**Neural Network to style your images**

Style of one image is transferred to the other. Used gram matrix to extract the style of the image calculated from the convolution layers of the VGG19 network. This is an implementation of [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) *Gatys (CVPR 2016)* paper.
